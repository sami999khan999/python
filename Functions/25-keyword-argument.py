# keyword argument = A keyword argument is an argument passed to a function by explicitly specifying the parameter name along with its corresponding value. This makes the code more readable and allows you to pass arguments in a different order than the function definition.


def greet(first_name, last_name):
    print("Hello," + first_name + " " + last_name)


greet(last_name="Khan", first_name="Sami")
