# Parent class: Shape

# Create an instance of Circle and display its area and inherited attributes.
circle = Circle("Red", True, 4)
circle.area()  # Output: The area of the circle is 50.264 (approximately)
print(circle.color)  # Output: Red (inherited from Shape)
print(circle.filled)  # Output: True (inherited from Shape)

# Create an instance of Square and display its area and inherited attributes.
square = Square("Blue", False, 5)
square.area()  # Output: The area of the square is 25

# Explanation of the super() function:
# 1. super().__init__(color, filled) calls the constructor of the parent class (Shape)
#    from within the child classes (Circle and Square). This ensures that the common
#    attributes 'color' and 'filled' are properly initialized.
#
# 2. Without using super(), you would have to manually set 'color' and 'filled' in each child class,
#    leading to redundant code.
#
# 3. The super() function promotes code reusability and cleaner code by leveraging the parent's logic,
#    while still allowing the child class to add its own specific attributes (like radius or width).

# Summary:
# - The Shape class serves as the base class with common attributes.
# - Circle and Square inherit from Shape and use super() to initialize shared attributes.
# - Each child class adds its own unique properties and methods (e.g., area calculations).
# - The super() function simplifies calling parent methods and constructors, making inheritance more efficient.
